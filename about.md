Hello and welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Matthew Cruz.
I am a traditionally trained mechanical design engineer and I have just completed my Master's degree in Robotics from Northwestern University, near Chicago, Illinois. 

As you browse my page you will see some of my past projects. However, as I try to stay current, you will be able to see my current projects and endeavours in Robotics.

If you have any questions about my work please feel free to click on the contact tab in the top right corner of the page to get ahold of me.
