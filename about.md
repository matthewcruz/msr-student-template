## Overview
Hello and Welcome! to my personal Portfolio. My name is Matthew Cruz, and I am a traditionally trained mechanical engineer with the added bonus of currently persuing a Master's degree in Robotics from Northwestern University, just north of Chicago, Illinois. 

This portfolio should give you, the curious mind, a chance to get to know my project and work experience in the past - as a mechanical engineer- and my experience and outlook as new Roboticist.

AS you peruse my page you will see some past work, however, as I try to stay current, you will be able to see my current projects and endeavours in Robotics.

If you have any questions for me personally or are curious about some of my projects please feel free to click on the contact tab in the top right corner of the page to get ahold of me.

As a added note, I have added some of my core research interests in robotics.

### Robotics Research interests
* Computer Vision and 3D scanning
* Haptics
* Biomimetics
