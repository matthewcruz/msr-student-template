## Overview
From 2010 until summer of 2015 I worked as a Mechanical design engineer in the medical device industry in Orange County, California. Working in this field gave me a broad exposure and deep understanding of deisgn engineering at its core.

I was able to get my hands dirty working in lab, testing, and iterating serval designs which gave me a multitude of experience in design for manufacturing, prototyping and, most import of all, general design rules of thumb in the mechanical world.

### Experiences
My contribution to previous work gave me hands-on practice which allowed me to develop as an engineer in the following core competencies.
<body>
    <li>Design and analysis of conveyance systems</li>
    <li>Manufacturing processes such as castings, machining, forming, and molding</li>
    <li>Hydropneumatic systems and</li>
    <li>General servo/stepper motor controls</li>
</body>
