## Overview
As of September 2015 I am pursuing the Master's of Science in Robotics at Northwestern University (MSR). This program is designed to bring several core engineering skills together with hands-on project experience in robotics. 

### MSR 2015 Hackathon
The 2015 MSR cohort completed a 3-Day Hackathon which challenged students in groups of 3-4 to utilize ROS, python programming and a pan-tilt webcam with servo driver kit to identify and track the center of a red ball when placed in front of the camera.
