## Overview
As of September 2015 I am persuing the Master's of Science in Robotics at Northwestern University (MSR). This program is designed to bring several core engineering skills together with hands-on project experience in robotics. 

### MSR 2015 Hackathon
As of today, the MSR cohort has completed the 2015 MSR Hackathon, which was a 3-day intensive race to utilize ROS, programming and a pan-tilt webcam and servo driver kit to identify and track a red ball placed in fron the of the camera.
The hackathon was a success!
