## Overview
As of September 2015 I am persuing the Master's of Science in Robotics at Northwestern University (MSR). This program is designed to bring several core engineering skills together with hands-on project experience in robotics. 

### MSR 2015 Hackathon
As of today, the MSR cohort has completed the 2015 MSR Hackathon. The Hackathon was a 3-day challenge to utilize ROS, programming and a pan-tilt webcam with servo driver kit to identify and track the center of a red ball whe placed in front of the camera.
The hackathon was a success!
