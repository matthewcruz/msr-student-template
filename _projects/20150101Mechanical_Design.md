## Overview
After obtaining a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2010 I worked as a design engineer for nearly five years in the medical device industry in Orange County, California. Working in this field gave me broad exposure and deep understanding of design engineering at its core. 
I worked in a hands-on lab environment creating prototype designs which I would analyze, verify, validate, document and release to production.
Following my work in industry, I have had the opportunity to work for individual clientelle to create custom designs.

### Experience
Example work includes component level designs as well as full assemblies. Here are a few example projects:

<body> 
    <li>Design of elastomeric caps and respective family mold (see above)</li>
    <li>Sheet metal bracketing design </li>
    <li>Design of a precision hydropneumatic subassembly for reagent delivery and probe cleaning</li>
    <li>Prototyping of servo driven cam lifter mechanism </li>
    <li>Design of custom rotating retail display, incorporating variable speed, lighting and aesthetics</li>
</body>
    
### Competencies
My core competencies in mechanical design are:
<body>
    <li>Design for manufacturability</li>
    <li>Materials selection, material compatibility and design for reliability </li>
    <li>OEM selection and vendor interfacing</li>
    <li>Manufacturing processes
    <ul>
    <li>Casting (die, "V", sand)</li>
    <li>Machining</li>
    <li>Forming (vacuum, sheet metal)</li>
    <li>Molding (blow, injection, compression, structural foam ) </li>
    <li> Finishes (passivation, anodization, powdercoat)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Tolerance Stackup Analysis</li>
    <li>Surface Modelling</li>
    <li>Precision instrumentation, conveyance systems, and Hydropneumatic/fluidic systems</li>
    <li> GD&T and 2D documentation</li>
</body>
