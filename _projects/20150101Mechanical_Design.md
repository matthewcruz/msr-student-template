## Overview
From 2010 until summer of 2015 I worked as a Mechanical design engineer for a medial device company in Orange County, California. Working in this field gave me broad exposure and deep understanding of design engineering at its core. By virtue of the lab environment, I was able touch all facets of the research and design process. 

I had the chance to bring several design iterations from testing through verification/validation to release, allowing for experience in design for manufacturing, prototyping and -most import of all- general design rule of thumb in the mechanical world.

### Experience
My core competencies in mechanical design are:
<body>
    <li>Design for manufacturability</li>
    <li>Materials selection and design for reliability </li>
    <li>Manufacturing processes
    <ul>
    <li>Casting (die, "V", sand)</li>
    <li>Machining</li>
    <li>Forming (vacuum, sheet metal)</li>
    <li>Molding (blow, injection, compression, structural foam ) </li>
    <li> Finishes (passivation, anodization, powdercoat)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Precision instrumentation, conveyance systems, and Hydropneumatic/fluidic systems</li>
    <li> GD&T and 2D documentation</li>
</body>
