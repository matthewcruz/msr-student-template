## Overview
During a final project for Professor Bryan Pardo's class in "Machine Perception of Audio and Music" myself and two colleagues worked together to develop a software program called "InstruSwitch".
InstruSwitch allows the user to either load an audio file or hum/sing/whistle a monophic melody. which is then and played back as though it were played by another instrument.

From a technical point of view, this software uses a "Yin" algorithm based pitch tracker along with some additional filtering to take in an audio signal, track the pitch and convert that signal into a midi file. The result can be played back through a stored soundbank of audio samples of several instruments.
