## Overview
During a final project for Professor Bryan Pardo's class in "Machine Perception of Music and Audio" myself and two colleagues developed a software program called "InstruSwitch".

InstruSwitch allows the user to either load an audio file or record themself hum/sing/whistle a monophic melody, which the software then proceses and plays back as though it were played by another instrument.

The software uses a "Yin" algorithm-based pitch tracker along with additional filtering to take in an audio signal, track the pitch and convert that signal into a midi file. The resulting midi can be played back through a stored soundbank of audio samples of several instruments.
