## Overview
During a fall quarter mini-project myself and three others programmed <a href="http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter/">Baxter</a> from Rethink Robotics &#174; using the Robot Operating System (<a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a>) platform to pick and place blocks in three dimensions. To accomplish the task demonstrated in the video linked below, AR tags were used to locate the blocks and an algorithm was designed to select the blocks, position the arm and pick up/place the blocks in a goal location using a jacobian based solver for kinematics of the end effector position.
