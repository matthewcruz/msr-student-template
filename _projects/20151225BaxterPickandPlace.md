## Overview
During an end of term project myself and three others programmed <a href="http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter/">Baxter</a> from Rethink Robotics &#174; using the Robot Operating System (<a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a>) platform to pick and place blocks in the real world (See video below). To accomplish this task AR tags were used to locate the blocks and an algorithm was designed to select the blocks, position the arm and pick up/place the blocks in a goal location using a jacobian based solver for kinematics of the end effector position.
