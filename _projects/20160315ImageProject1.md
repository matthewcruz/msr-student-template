## Overview
During an end of term mini-project, myself and a colleague designed a software program using <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/about/">Python 2.7</a> to recognize the gesture of a human hand from a live video feed. Once identified, the tip of the index finger would be used as a cursor to fingerpaint on the screen.

Several fundamental and advanced concepts in computer vision were implemented in this project to achieve our goals, including background subtraction, DoG and non-maxima suppression (Canny), Hough Transform, color segmentation, connected components, as well as many others.
